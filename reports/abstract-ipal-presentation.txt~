Tracking in 3D+t Biomedical Data

The understanding of many biological process requires tracking of particles in a sequence of frames. This task has some features that hindering achieve good results like: complex dynamics of the objects, temporarily merging that leads to split after, noisy and blurry images, and cell division. This problem is usually modeled as a dense directed acyclic graph, trying to find an optimal solution that leads to a good tracking. I am improving an algorithm, with a similar aproach, but focus in two steps: find events and handle with events. The goal is make the algorithm to process efficiently that problems that happen in biomedical data.

The understanding of many biological processes requires tracking of particles in a sequence of frames. This task has some features that hindering achieve good results, like complex dynamics of the objects, temporarily merging that leads to split after, cell division, noisy and blurry images. This problem is usually modeled as a dense directed acyclic graph or an optical flow problem. 

Recently related works have been used different strategies to solve this problem. We highlight three generic approaches from these previous works. In the first one, the problem is modeled as a matrix, that represents a complete bipartite graph. This model was extended recently to optimize the solution globally in a spatial and temporal manner. So  the particle that can disappear in a period of time, is also processed. In the second approach, the problem is modeled as an optical flow. It does not get an optimal solution globally in the time.  In the third approach is proposed a fast algorithm using dynamic programming solution to solve K+1 shortest-path problems. 

The two first approaches evaluate their results using biomedical datasets. In their solution, it was taken into consideration only two features, spatial distance, and pixel intensity. The last approach was evaluated in a pedestrian dataset. Because that, it does not take into consideration some characteristics found in biomedical data, like cell division.

We propose a generic framework that provides an easy interface. It can be used to implement different strategies and algorithms, using the same structure. To solve the problem, we propose a strategy similar to the first approach cited before. But we focused on events detection. This leads to a larger number of features, like colocalization and shape of the particles, improving the accuracy of the solution. Besides that, we adapt our model in order to use the fast algorithm proposed in the last approach cited before. 

We test our algorithm using a benchmark to the comparison of cell tracking algorithms. It compares our algorithm result with the ground truth and gives a quantitative evaluation.
